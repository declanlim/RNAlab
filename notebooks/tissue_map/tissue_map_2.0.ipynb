      "Multiple matches found for A growing body of evidence supports the notion that the gut microbiome plays an important role in cancer immunity. However, the underpinning mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. One attractive hypothesis envisages that among the T cells elicited by the plethora of microbiome proteins a few exist that incidentally recognize neo-epitopes arising from cancer mutations (molecular mimicry (MM) hypothesis). To support MM, the human probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle was engineered with the SIINFEKL epitope (OVA-E.coli Nissle) and orally administered to C57BL6 mice. The treatment with OVA-E.coli Nissle, but not with wild type E. coli Nissle, induced OVA-specific CD8+ T cells and inhibited the growth of tumors in mice challenged with B16F10 melanoma cells expressing OVA. The microbiome shotgun sequencing and the sequencing of TCRs from T cells recovered from both lamina propria and tumors provide evidence that the main mechanism of tumor inhibition is mediated by the elicitation at the intestinal site of cross-reacting T cells, which subsequently reach the tumor environment. Importantly, the administration of Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) from engineered E. coli Nissle, as well as from E. coli BL21(DE3)DompA, carrying cancer-specific T cell epitopes also elicited epitope-specific T cells in the intestine and inhibited tumor growth. Overall, our data strengthen the important role of MM in tumor immunity and assign a novel function of OMVs in host-pathogen interaction. Moreover, our results pave the way to the exploitation of probiotics and OMVs engineered with tumor specific-antigens as personalized mucosal cancer vaccines.\n",
      "Multiple matches found for The moose (Alces alces) manages to utilize energy from fiber-rich lignocellulose material through enzymes produced by the microbes in its rumen. Some of these specialized enzymes may outperform cellulases and hemicellulases that are used in bio-refinery processes today. Shotgun metagenomics offers a method to study microbial communities in detail and to capture the gene sequences coding for enzymes that can be produced in the laboratory. We applied the technique on rumen material from moose. Through a binning approach, a large number of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from single species and strains were isolated and characterized based on taxonomy and carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZY) profile. Most of the 99 MAGs were classified to the bacterial phyla Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes, which is in agreement with previous studies of rumen from moose and other herbivores. Phylogenomic analysis of MAGs revealed novel clades within Bacteriodetes with no related previously characterized genome. In addition, new genomes that were closely related to the recently described Melainabacteria, newly proposed candidate divisions SR1 and TM7 and previously uncharacterized Alphaproteobacteria were also retrieved. Putative cellulolytic functions were observed in several clades of Bacteroidetes and for MAGs of genus Ruminococcus, Fibrobacteres, and Treponema. Cellulosome components were present in MAGs of Ruminococcus but also in certain clades of Bacteroidetes. Cellulosomes are generally described in the Firmicutes family Clostridiales. Multiple putative cellulases were identified within species from several phyla. At a general level, the most frequently occurring polysaccharide-degrading enzymes targeted hemicellulose, starch and pectin. This study describes the first shotgun-metagenomic characterization of moose rumen and the high number of reconstructed genomes provides a valuable link between phylogeny and cellulolytic role.\n",
      "Multiple matches found for Colorectal cancer, a commonly diagnosed cancer in the elderly, often develops slowly from benign polyps called adenoma. The gut microbiota, with its critical roles in nutrient metabolism and immune modulation, is believed to be directly involved in colorectal carcinogenesis. The identity and functional capacity of the adenoma- or carcinoma-related gut microbe(s), however, have not been surveyed in a comprehensive manner. Here we perform metagenomewide association study (MGWAS) on stools from healthy controls, advanced adenoma and carcinoma patients, revealing gene markers from over 100 bacterial strains enriched in each group.\n",
